# weSplit

> In this project weâ€™re going to be building a check-splitting app that you might use after eating at a restaurant â€“ you enter the cost of your food,
>  select how much of a tip you want to leave, and how many people youâ€™re with, and it will tell you how much each person needs to pay.
